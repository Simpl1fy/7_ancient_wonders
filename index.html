                        <p>
                            The Great Pyramid of Giza was built in 2570 BC and is still standing today. It is believed to have taken 20 years and as many as 100,000 workers to complete the Great Pyramid, which was built as a tomb for the 4th dynasty Egyptian pharaoh named Khufu. It was built as part of a complex that included temples and many other pyramids.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The outermost stones of the pyramid were highly polished white limestone, which were eventually loosened by an
                            earthquake more than 600 years ago, and were removed to help build cities and mosques. When these casing stones were
                            present, some believe that the pyramid was so large and bright that it could be seen from the moon.

                        <p>
                            The Lighthouse of Alexandria (ὁ Φάρος τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας) was built in 280 BC and was destroyed by earthquake in 1323 AD.
                            Located on the island of Pharos in the harbor of Alexandria, the lighthouse may be the most famous lighthouse in
                            history. The lighthouse was very different than modern lighthouses in that it was built in three stages, all sloping
                            inward. Built of marble blocks with lead mortar; the lowest was square, the next octagonal, and the top cylindrical.
                            Within the lighthouse was a ramp and "dumbwaiter" that allowed wood to be transported to the fire that burned at night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inside the open top of the lighthouse was a large curved mirror that was used to reflect the sunlight during the day and
                            the fire at night. It is said that mariners could see the light up to 35 miles away. Legends have it that the light was
                            so bright it could be used to burn enemy ships.

                        <h3>A Monument of Love and Power</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Μαυσωλεῖον Ἁλικαρνασσεύς) was built in 352 BC and was destroyed by earthquake in 1404
                            AD. The monument was built as a tomb for Mausolus, a governor in the Persian Empire. Sparing no expense, his widowed
                            wife Artemisia (who was also his sister as was considered customary) commissioned well-known Greek architects and
                            artists to design the tomb and sculptural reliefs for each of the four sides of the building.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The monument was almost square, nearly 14 stories tall, and its base was more than 10,000 square feet. Each side of the
                            tomb had nine massive columns, and the top was a stepped pyramid on which stood by a four-horse marble chariot in which
                            there were images of Mausolus and Artemisia.

                        <p>
                            The Colossus of Rhodes (Κολοσσός της Ρόδου) was built in 282 BC and was destroyed by earthquake in 226 BC. In 294 BC,
                            the people of the island of Rhodes began building a colossal statue of the sun god Helios. They believed that it was
                            because of his blessings that they were able to withstand a long siege on the island and emerge victorious.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Colossus was built with bronze, reinforced with iron, and weighted with stones. While it is often depicted
                            straddling Mandrákion harbor, this is now considered technically impossible; and therefore, it likely stood beside the
                            harbor.

                            The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Ἀρτεμίσιον) was built in 550 BC and was destroyed by fire in 356 BC. The Temple of
                            Artemis at Ephesus was built and rebuilt over the course of many years. The most famous was built in about 550 BC and
                            was funded by King Croesus of Lydia.

                        <p>
                            Unlike many other temples of its time, it was built of marble and glittered with gold. The temple's foundation was over
                            180 by 350 feet and its steps led to a high platform on which stood more than one hundred beautifully sculptured columns
                            that supported its roof. At least twice the size of the Parthenon, it was so breathtaking it was said to rise to the
                            clouds.

                            The Statue of Zeus at Olympia (Δίας μυθολογία) was built in 430 BC and was destroyed by fire in 426 AD. Carved from
                            ivory, on a throne of cedarwood, the statue was created by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 430 BC. In its right hand
                            was a life-size statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in its left was a large sceptre topped with an eagle. The
                            statue, nearly 40 feet tall, was said to fill the entire width of the one of the aisles of the Temple of Zeus, and its
                            head nearly scraped the temple's ceiling.

                        <p>
                            In 426 AD, the temple was destroyed and many historians believe that the statue was destroyed at that time. Others
                            believe, however, that the statue was moved to Constantinople (now Istanbul) and was destroyed about 50 years later.

                            The Hanging Gardens of Babylon was built in 600 BC and was destroyed by earthquake in 226 BC. The first and most
                            interesting fact about the gardens is that there is significant controversy about whether the gardens existed at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether they did or did not exist, there are many elaborate accounts and poetic descriptions of the gardens. They are
                            generally believed to have been built by King Nebuchadrezzar II for his wife because she missed the gardens of her home.
                            Some research suggests that it was an elaborate series of rooftop gardens. Another theory suggests that the gardens were
                            built in the walls of the royal palace.
